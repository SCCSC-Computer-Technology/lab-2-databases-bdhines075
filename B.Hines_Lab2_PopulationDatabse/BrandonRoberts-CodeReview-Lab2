The code was easy to follow along with and had plenty of comments to inform anyone of what you was trying to accomplish. I like the way you used try/catch statement on the save button to make sure it would work.
From looking at your code I didn't see how there would be any issues with the program working properly.
You used try/catch statements and I didn't, also you code different than I do, there were a lot of differences in our code.
This code is great, I think you are doing a great job and I don't think you will have any issues with this class.
