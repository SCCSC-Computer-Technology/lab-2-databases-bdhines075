Code Review
Lab 2

To Start I really like the layout of the Web App. I think it's very visually pleasing and super easy to read and understand. The code was very clean and overall doesn't have very many rendunancies. It's clean and doesn't even go over 80 lines of code so it was able to acheive a lot of what was asked in a very samll amount of lines.
Overall the application is clean and very efficient. I do think they are missing a button to showcase the details of a specific city but besides that it doesn't have any erros or issues. The filters work instantly. I would also like to see the population info like total or average without having to click the button to output it onto the box. 
Very nicely done that the app is able to save any changes made to the report. Great Job!
